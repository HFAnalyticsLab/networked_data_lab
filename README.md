## The Networked Data Lab on GitHub

Welcome to the Networked Data Lab's central landing page on GitHub, where we all our code repositories and other resources are referenced in one place.

### :link: What is the Networked Data Lab?

The [Networked Data Lab](https://www.health.org.uk/funding-and-partnerships/our-partnerships/the-networked-data-lab) is a collaborative network of analytical teams across the UK working together using linked datasets on key issues facing health and care services today. We started in 2020, and we work closely with our five partners across the UK who are embedded within their local health and care systems and have detailed knowledge of both their local health and care environments and their linked data sets. Our five teams work on a new topic approximately every year, with each topic resulting in outputs (including, but not limited to, publications).

#### Our approach to open analytics

As a network, we aim to work as openly and collaboratively as possible. This includes publicly sharing our analysis plans (which includes our methodology for each analysis), codes used in analyses (SQL and R) and other analytical resources (such as clinical code lists or data extraction pipelines). A limitation is that many of the codes used by our partners (and shared here) are intented for use on patient healthcare records, which we cannot make publicly available because of ethical considerations. However, these codes can be used by other teams who have secured access to similar patient records.

### :one: Topic 1: COVID-19 and the clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) population (2020-2021)

**Central analyses**

These are analyses either using open data, or where data definitions were standardised across all five labs to enable five identical analyses using secure-access health care records.
